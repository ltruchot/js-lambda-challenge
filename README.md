**The problem**

Define functions range, map, reverse and foreach, obeying the restrictions below, such that the following program works properly.
It prints the squares of numbers from 1 to 10, in reverse order.

**Restrictions**

You must not use arrays. The square bracket characters, [ and ], are forbidden, as well as new Array.

You must not use objects. The curly braces, { and }, and the dot character (.) are forbidden. 

You may use curly braces for code blocks, but not for creating JavaScript objects.

You must not use `for`, `while`, `switch` or `if`, but you can use ternary (like in `true ? "this" : "that"`).


Should go without saying, these functions must be generic and do what their name implies. They must not be hard-coded for the particular 1..10 example.
